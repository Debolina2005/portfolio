# ðŸ¤– web develop (Web-Based)

## ðŸ“– Overview  
This is a beginner-friendly web develop project that simulates between the user and profile viewers. Built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask)**, this project demonstrates how front-end and back-end technologies can work together to create an interactive chatbot experience.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **User sends a message** through the web interface.  
2. **JavaScript** sends the message to the **Flask backend**.  
3. The backend applies simple rule-based logic to generate a response.  
4. The chatbotâ€™s response is sent back and displayed in the browser.  
5. This process continues in real-time for each interaction.
